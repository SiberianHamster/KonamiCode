This is my variation on the Konami Code.  I wanted something to keep track of the correct keys and wipe out anything that isn't correct. I used Jquery because it was 4am when I woke up and had a moment of clarity and also becuase we had just learned a ton on Jquery.

This code relies on an empty section tag with the id of kcode within the html file that it is going to effect.

<section id="kcode"></section>

It injects an empty div tag into the DOM whenever a correct key is entered and a correct key is checked against the number of DIVs vs the array of correct keys.  If at anytime and incorrect key is entered, the Section is emptied out.

When all keys are entered, the codeEntered becomes true, and you can add functions to call after line 9 or use the true to trigger something else.

Since this is using jquery and keydown press, it will always be listening.

This was originally used in my Final Group Project for my bootcamp course at Codefellows.  The reason I added this...becuaes I can and I promised myself that I would include it in one of my bootcamp project.
